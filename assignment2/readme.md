Data Analysis
---

**Data Set**

The alphabetic list on the AO3 film page.

**Data Volume**

5849

**Analysis Dimension**

What genre of films are popular in AO3 ?

What film is the most attractive so fans recreated it the most?

How classic are some films?

The data shows the history of AO3 film fanworking. We can see the rise of fandom culture taking film genre as a tip of iceberg. Besides the online faction about which hero film is better has been going since a long time ago. The product of fandom on AO3 is shown as an evidence about the popularity about the two mian comic works, Marvel and DC.It turns out DC is far away from Marvel in the aspect of reproducting.This data shows the comparision about the number of works of several hot films.

**weakness and limitation**

As to this dataset itself, I have to give up scraping the interaction between viewers and fanwork authors.It is an another straight forward way to discuss the situation of film fandom. The number of the interaction is huge and more informative.

Film is one aspect of original work.Due to the influence of Japanese "nijigen" culture, many fans also got involved in animation and comicbooks reproduction.AND that is another heavy-rotation topic for many fanwork.I cannot scrape this kind of work in AO3 because of time limit.
